## Frequency-modulated reference oscillator

As part of my study of [phase-locked loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop) algorithms, I've been playing around with oscillators.  In an attempt to gain a more intuitive feel for the effect of changes to oscillator configurations, I've build a small d3.js visualization, herewith presented.
